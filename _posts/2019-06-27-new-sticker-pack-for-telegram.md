Is there a better way to start a blog than with a cats related post?

**NO, THERE IS NOT**

If you have been following me on Instagram, you SURELY have seen my stories (because you have, *haven't you??*), so this 
will look familiar to you. For those who don't (*shame* on you!), I posted a stories with a cat's design, asking if you 
knew what I was working on:

## Well, I finally have good news

I have been working in a Telegram Sticker pack, and it's available for everyone who wants it! It is still not complete, as 
I am adding new stickers every now and then, but you can get it already and use it! Here you have the link:
